	<h2> about </h2>
	<p> Hello! My name is Michelle, and welcome to my website! I am a senior in high school and I am looking to pursue a career in computer science with a focus in machine learning and networking. I was directly admitted to computer science at the University of Washington and I will be attending there in the fall of 2018. I placed 47th in the nation in the Cisco NetRiders competition, in which I competed against college students from around the nation as a high school student. I am also a Cisco Certified Networking Associate, after participating in the Newport Cisco Networking Academy for three years. I have also traveled to the island of Antigua in the Caribbean to install and replace computer labs in primary schools. </p>
