	<h2> about </h2>
	<p> Hello! My name is Michelle, and welcome to my website! I am a freshman in college and I am looking to pursue a career in computer science with a focus in predictive analytics in cybersecurity. I was directly admitted to computer science at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, where I am currently attending. I placed 47th in the nation in the Cisco NetRiders competition, in which I competed against college students from around the nation as a high school student. I am also a Cisco Certified Networking Associate, after participating in the Newport Cisco Networking Academy for three years. I have also traveled to the island of Antigua in the Caribbean to install and replace computer labs in primary schools. </p>
